# Commit Log Guide

This folder tracks what was delivered in each meaningful commit.

## How to use
1. Create one markdown file per commit (or per logical change set).
2. Name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-topic>.md`.
3. Include scope, changed files, validation results, and linked issues.

## Why this exists
1. Keep thesis/project progress auditable.
2. Keep product + engineering artifacts aligned.
3. Make review and retrospective easier.
