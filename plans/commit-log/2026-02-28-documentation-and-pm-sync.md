## Commit
- Message: docs(pm): sync project status and next-phase execution priorities
- Hash: (to fill after commit)

## Scope
Synchronize project documentation and milestone management artifacts with current implementation state.

## What was added/changed
1. Updated project overviews in `docs/zh/00` and `docs/en/00` to reflect Phase 2 priorities.
2. Added status snapshots to milestone docs in `docs/zh/02` and `docs/en/02`.
3. Updated multi-agent contract and flow-overview docs (`docs/zh|en/08`, `docs/zh|en/09`) to reflect existing runtime skeleton.
4. Updated implementation handoff in `docs/zh/07` from runtime-bootstrap focus to G6/G7/G8 focus.
5. Updated Epic G backlog with explicit progress state (`plans/milestones/issue-backlog-g-trading-execution-v0.1.md`).
6. Added weekly status snapshot:
   - `plans/milestones/weekly-status-2026-02-28.md`

## Validation
1. Command run: `bash scripts/ci/check_repo.sh`
2. Result: pass

## Linked Issues
- Epic G (G6/G7/G8)

## Notes
- This update intentionally focuses on project-management consistency and does not change runtime behavior.
