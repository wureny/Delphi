# Delphi Ontology

This folder contains the executable ontology artifacts for Delphi.

## Current modeling stance
1. The ontology is a semantic layer above raw source data, not a direct mirror of storage tables or API payloads.
2. The current market ontology is optimized for agent reasoning, explicit relationship traversal, and future decision-path traceability.
3. The current scope is intentionally limited to Polymarket `crypto` and `finance` markets.
4. Modeling choices are aligned with official Polymarket concepts: an event groups one or more markets, each market is the fundamental tradable proposition, and order book availability depends on `enableOrderBook`.
5. The ontology separates three layers:
   - market semantics
   - market microstructure
   - derived reliability / robust-signal analysis

## Current contents
- `schemas/core-entity-dictionary.md`: human-readable entity definitions and semantic modeling choices.
- `schemas/polymarket-ontology.schema.json`: machine-readable schema contract for the current market ontology.
- `samples/polymarket-sample-bundle.json`: sample bundle aligned with the current schema and generated by the executable pipeline.
- `samples/raw/`: sample Gamma, CLOB, and external-news inputs for the local pipeline.
- `samples/benchmarks/`: labeled benchmark cases and a reserved `live-cases/` archive for real snapshots.
- `samples/multi-agent/`: sample per-agent context packets derived from ontology bundles.
- `mappings/polymarket-field-mapping.json`: multi-source mapping draft informed by official Polymarket docs.
- `schemas/fund-execution-entity-dictionary.md`: fund execution entity definitions.
- `schemas/fund-execution-ontology.schema.json`: machine-readable contract for execution domain.
- `samples/fund-execution-sample-bundle.json`: sample trading and execution bundle.
- `mappings/fund-execution-mapping.json`: mapping from agent decisions/execution logs.

## Current market ontology priorities
1. Make entities and relationships explicit for agents.
2. Keep provenance anchors to raw Polymarket identifiers where needed.
3. Represent settlement at the market level.
4. Add order-book and trade semantics so agents do not over-index on a single displayed price.
5. Output a derived `MarketMicrostructureState` so downstream agents can weight market-implied signals by reliability.
6. Archive thin-book and anomalous live cases for regression, not just hand-written toy examples.
7. Add a repeatable labeling workflow so archived live cases can become benchmark-ready.
8. Use rolling windows and segmented persistence for longer-running stream capture jobs.
9. Avoid uncontrolled expansion to all categories before validation quality is good enough.

## MarketMicrostructureState
The current derived state includes:
- `displayed_probability`
- `robust_probability`
- `book_reliability_score`
- `trade_reliability_score`
- `manipulation_risk_score`
- `signal_weights`
- `depth_imbalance`
- `quote_trade_divergence`
- `explanatory_tags`

The design intent is to give agents a robust market-implied signal that can fall back toward prior market probability when the visible book is shallow, unconfirmed, or dominated by tiny trades.

## Multi-agent bridge
Primary agent implementations now live in `agents/`, while `scripts/ontology/*` keeps backward-compatible CLI wrappers.

The repo now includes a minimal bridge from ontology bundles into agent-specific packets:
- `scripts/ontology/build_multi_agent_context.py`
- `ontology/samples/multi-agent/polymarket-agent-context-sample.json`

This layer currently prepares:
- `research_agent_packets`
- `strategy_agent_packets`
- `risk_agent_packets`
- `audit_agent_packets`
- `candidate_decisions`

It is the current handoff point between market ontology and the later execution-domain `DecisionRecord` / `Order` / `Execution` chain.

The repo also now includes two minimal pre-orchestration utilities:
- `scripts/ontology/build_decision_records.py`
- `scripts/ontology/evaluate_risk_policy_gate.py`
- `scripts/ontology/build_order_proposals.py`
- `scripts/ontology/simulate_paper_execution.py`

The repo now also includes a minimal runtime skeleton:
- `scripts/ontology/run_multi_agent_runtime.py`

They are meant to prove that the current ontology and multi-agent context are already sufficient to:
1. produce execution-domain `DecisionRecord` objects, and
2. run a deterministic risk gate,
3. produce minimal `Order` proposals,
4. run paper-trading simulation updates for `Execution -> Position/PnL`.

The runtime skeleton currently orchestrates packet consumption and emits the same downstream contract while keeping the implementation intentionally simple for incremental hardening.
It now supports a concrete `llm` runtime mode with OpenAI-compatible API integration, plus offline mock responses for local testing without network credentials.
It supports two source modes: prebuilt `--agent-context` and direct `--ontology-bundle` (which auto-builds multi-agent context before orchestration).
It also supports optional per-session runtime memory persistence via `--runtime-memory-path` for context continuity across repeated runs.

## Next expected issues
1. Stronger case labeling workflow for archived live cases.
2. Continuous stream deployment and longer-running market capture jobs.
3. Historical calibration of `robust_probability` and risk thresholds against external ground truth.
4. Relationship cardinality and graph constraints beyond basic JSON schema.
5. JSON -> graph export (Neo4j).
6. Execution safety gates and human-in-the-loop approval flow.
