# Agent Working Rules

## Critical Communication Rule
If I cannot complete a key task explicitly requested by the user (for example, required dependency/framework setup), I must state that clearly and immediately.

I must not silently switch scope, hide failure, or continue with unrelated work as a substitute.

I should ask for next-step direction when blocked, instead of making unapproved pivots.
